# CS320 - Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance  
### Brianna Reed  
This repository showcases my work in software testing, unit testing, and automation from CS320 at Southern New Hampshire University. The projects demonstrate my ability to develop, validate, and maintain high quality software using Java, JUnit, and best testing practices.


## Projects Overview
### Project One: Contact, Task, and Appointment Services
Location: ðŸ“‚ [`Project-One/`](./Project-One)  
Focus Areas:

-Implemented Contact, Task, and Appointment services to enforce strict validation and constraints

-Used JUnit testing to validate core functionalities

-Applied exception handling to catch invalid inputs



Key Lessons:

-Writing effective unit tests improves software reliability.

-Automated testing catches errors earlier, reducing debugging time.

-Handling edge cases prevents system vulnerabilities.



### Project Two: Software Testing Summary & Reflections  
Location: ðŸ“‚ [`Project-Two/`](./Project-Two)  
Focus Areas:

-Analyzed different testing strategies and their effectiveness

-Reflected on how unit testing ensures functional software

-Explored improvements in test driven development (TDD)



Key Takeaways:

-Unit tests provide a safety net for future development

-Exploratory testing remains necessary beyond automation

-CI/CD pipelines improve efficiency but require structured testing


## Reflection Questions 
### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? 
Ensuring functionality and security comes down to rigorous testing, validation constraints, and defensive coding practices. I wrote JUnit tests to enforce string length limits, numerical constraints, and input validation to prevent common software vulnerabilities. 

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Understanding user needs starts with requirement analysis. By defining expected behaviors (valid phone numbers, appointment date limits, ect.), I translated these needs into testable constraints. 

### How do I approach designing software? 
My approach follows test driven development (TDD) - designing tests before implementation to guide the structure. I focus on:

-Defining constraints early to prevent invalid input.

-Writing modular code for easier debugging and scalability.

-Using automated tests to validate every function.
